    Hello

    “If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born,
    and what my lousy childhood was like ,
    and how my parents were occupied before they had me,
    and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it,
    if you want to know the truth.”
